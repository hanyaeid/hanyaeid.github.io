                     I seared chicken breast with some ginger-garlic lemongrass paste I had from before, along with carrots and celery. Added water, coconut milk, bay leaves and cardamom, and let it simmer ~2hrs. Soup! </p>

                  I also made a crispy ginger garnish with some julienned garlic fried in oil, and toasted some whole-wheat bread using the remaining oil. There's a thin layer of cream cheese whipped with rose honey and black pepper on the toast </p>

                      The dates caramelize really nicely and give a nice deep sweetness contrasted by bitter olives. It was also falling off the bone effortlessly. Awesome experience  </p>

               For someone who enjoys steak as much as I do, I don't make it nearly enough. When I do, it's the ultimate treat - often paired with store brand white cheddar

                     Cleaning the hearts was simple and straightforward, which made the process more pleseant. I ended up searing the hearts first with heaps of onion and aromatics before adding tomato paste and water. <br>
                      I didn't exactly replicate that childhood nostalgic taste I was looking for, but I wasn't upset by how they turned out. I definitely overcooked them given how chewy they were, but all 
                      in all, this was succesful. I had these over rice and some blanched/pan-fried asparagus for a quick weeknight dinner. </p>

                  Following my usual cinnamon roll recipe, I added some ground nutmeg, cardamom, and clove to the cinnamon-sugar butter spread. I also steeped a couple chai handbags in some heavy cream to make this quick and easy glaze(?).<br>
               These were incredible, as always, and make a recurring appearance in my cinnamon roll rotation. <br>
               I made these as a thank you to a friend for letting me cat-sit for them, and they said they equally enjoyed them :) Reviews were glowing from everyone else too, 10/10</p>

                  <p class="body_text"> I had an abundance of cheese about to go bad, and friends I hadn't seen in a while due to a hectic work schedule. Naturally and logically, this called for a bbq.<br>
                     I made a pretty awesome mac&cheese, if I do say so myself. The criteria? It's simple: <br>
                     1)creamy, but not too saucy it lacks structural integrity<br>
                     2)zesty, hearty flavor (bland mac&cheese sucks)<br>
                     3)crispy exterior, soft and warm interior<br>
                     Safe to say, this delivered. I also made some Turkish kebab skewers with some spices traditionally found in Middle Eastern bbq. I grilled those on a propane grill, along with those peach slices (were also going to go bad), and they both had
                     that perfect smokey, charred summer flavor. I gave them a squeeze of lemon juice right off the grill for some brightness.<br>
                     Not pictured here is a garlic-dill and cucumber yogurt sauce to go with everything.<br>
                     Testimonials: <br>
                     -My friend Ben (certified picky-eater&trade;, mac&cheese avoider and sauce hater), said this is the only mac&cheese he will eat. Ben also had many skewers and said he'd pay me to make him 
                     those kebabs again<br>
                     -My friend Jesse (also certified picky-eater&trade; and honest person) said it was the best mac&cheese they've ever had.<br>
                     I've made so much sh*t throughout our friendship, so I know my friends aren't afraid to be honest with me ;)

                  <p class="body_text"> These were unfortunately....a miss, to put it kindly. This definitely tanked my confidence with bread/yeast, especially considering how high it used to be.<br>
                  I'm not really sure what went wrong here - they didn't rise as much as they should've, and had a very chewy (almost rubbery) texture. I think part of the problem is also that I put them onto this wire rack to rise/after taking them out of the waterbath, and I think that denatured the shape of them a bit.<br>
                  Having said that, the crust was satisfying and crunchy with a soft(er) interior,
               and any homemade "bread" trumps store bought bread as a breakfast vessel. I had some pretty decadant breakfast sandwiches that whole week - crispy fried egg, avocado, tomato, and homemade pickled red onions.</p>

                  <h2 class="title_text">coconut cake with spiced citrus buttercream </h2>
                  <p class="body_text"> 
                     I made this as a birthday cake for my friend Mik, and it was such a fun project! I don't bake a whole lot anymore (and when I do it's bread), so it's fun to get back into it.<br>
                     This was 2 layers of a coconut sponge, which baked better than I expected! It had that perfect, airy crumble you want from a sponge cake. <br>
                     I made a spiced citrus buttercream with various citrus zests and juices (orange, lemon, and grapefruit) mixed with ginger, nutmeg and clove. The acidity from the citrus 
                     cut through the buttercream, which was unfrotunately quite fatty and dense (this is American buttercream slander).<br>
                     I tried decorating it with a coat of toasted coconut flakes on the outside, but it ultimately didn't do much to elevate the look. I think the biggest issue was how 
                     shabby the frosting was on the top. This was my first time frosting a whole cake (as well as piping the text) and for a first attempt, I don't think it's horrible.<br>
                     My one grievance with this cake was the texture of it after a couple days. The recipe I used called for drizzling some citrus juice directly on the sponge layers before frosting to 
                     retain some extra moisture. While fine at first, I found after a couple days in the fridge, the texture turned wet and rubbery, kind of like a soggy interior that cooled down and hardened into 
                     a gel over time, which I thought was weird since it was a minimal amount of citrus juice.<br>
                     Anyway.....my friend Mik never got the cake due to some unforeseen circumstances, but it's probably for the best. This tasted better than it looked, but it's hard to 
                     sell someone that concept. Better luck next year!

                  <p class="body_text"> Absolutely perfect shephard's pie. Nothing more to say, just look at it. Perfect crispy potato bits to go on a bed of moist and flavorful beef.<br>
                  I think without the history/cultural association and comfort tied to shepherd's pie, it can be a bit boring. However, it's fairly easy and rewarding to master.</p>

                  <p class="body_text"> These were a great way to ring in the new year. I had an entire duck in my freezer that I was chipping away at over the holidays.<br>
                     I ended up roasting the carcass to make stock (which was delicious), and was left with some mangled meat I managed to scrape off the carcass before roasting, which was perfect as the filling
                      for these wontons. I braised the meat in some of the duck stock with ginger, finely diced apples and green onions until it was all jammy and delicous.<br>
                      I then made a bunch of wontons :) I froze and ate these for months after. I really liked them fried till crispy and golden, with a chilli crisp/oil on the side. <br>I also 
                      enjoyed them in wonton soup, courtesy of the duck stock of course. </p>

                  <p class="body_text"> This flatbread was an attempt to salvage some wrecked pizza dough that would not stretch to a circle.<br>
                  I wanted to take it in a different direction than mishaped pizza, and came up with 2 seasonal flatbreads that I served with a generous drizzle of olive oil.<br>
                  The first, a light and summery bread topped with tomatoes, red onion, zuchinni and beets.<br>
                  The second, a fall inspired bread topped with halumi cheese, sweet potatoes, beets and caramelized onions.<br>
                  While both were delicious and a good way to creatively salvage some dough, I think some sort of sauce/base would elevate the flavors further and tie the toppings together better. </p>

                  <p class="body_text"> This was my first attempt making gnocchi, and it was an overall success! I've actually had trouble replicating how fluffy and rich these were, despite the fact there's no egg yolk in the dough.<br>
                     I made a TVP "meat" sauce with some clumps of TVP, crushed tomatoes, garlic, basil, and sundried tomatoes, and served with a drizzle of olive oil.
