                     Even though I only discovered this EP in the final days of this year, it's easily in my top 3. <br>
                     This EP is a very uplifting, casual listen. The instrumentals are a very funky 80's-future aesthetic that's so relaxing. The overall sound is very smooth and
                     dreamy, I thoroughly enjoyed every second of it.<br> 
                     The 3 tracks compete very strongly with each other for best, but I really like the instrumental breakdown at the end of My Jinji </p>

                  <p class="body_text">While this wasn't my first listen, it was my most recent and it reminded me of how much and why I love this album.<br>
                     Mitski's lyricism is unparalleled - for a debut album, the themes and the execution are minblowingly sophiscated. The sounds and emotions on this are uniquely harrowing; Mitski tackles issues of womanhood and societal expectations with simple yet emotive language . It's definitely not an everyday-casual 
                     listen, but it's a masochistic delight.<br>
                  It's hard to pick favorites, but Brand New City, Liquid Smooth and Bag of Bones are top 3 for sure. </p>

                  <h2 class="title_text">We Bring Anything to the Table...Except Tables. We Can't Bring Tables to the Table <br> The Red Pears</h2>
                  <p class="body_text"> With solid rock instrumental breakdowns throughout, The Red Pears are rather liberal leaning on the same trite distortive tune that plagues the alternative-rock scene nowadays.
                     I can't even blame them though, because they genuinely do it well. The staticy, distorted scream-o vocals match the frayed guitar perfectly to paint the perfect portrait of the angst that 
                     comes with being a young adult navigating complex relationships. <br>
                     Despite employing a classic indie production style and rock instrumental breakdowns, this album manages to maintain a spark of playfulness that can be found in some witty lyrics and experimental sound.
                     The suspensful anxiety-inducing beat on Time Bomb carries the song smoothly until the second half, where a fast breakdown gives that satisfying resolution to the suspenful ticking from before.<br>
                     Daylight/Moonlight has an irresistible, mellow swing to it that is a nice change of pace from more intensely-paced songs on this album. I also really enjoyed Polar Chimps/T.R.P,

                  <p class="date_text">Dec, 2023</p>
                  <h2 class="title_text">Historian <br>Lucy Dacus</h2>
                  <p class="body_text"> My first, uninterrupted listen for this album was very recent, and I was not disappointed. <br>
                     Lucy Dacus has a signature warm, lullaby-esque voice that rings out in your mind. It is gentle and crisp and powerful all at the same time.<br>
                     As an artist, her style places heavy emphasis in the story she's singing, and in this album, it's a story of grief and self-discovery, mostly in the way we relate to and live through people. 
                     Historian showcases Dacus's ability to make music that is relatable in more than one sense; while Lucy sings about such familiar and 
                     quintiessential parts of the experience of love and loss, she does it in a way that centers and immerses the listener in a story told so vividly, it's 
                     almost impossible not to self-project onto the songs here.<br>
                     Night Shift is one of Dacus's best songs of all time - the instrumental build up overlayed with the strained scream-vocals and grungy guitar make it objectively one of the 
                     best songs ever. I also really like Addictions, Yours & Mine, and The Shell</p>

                  <h2 class="title_text">Guilty of Love <br>Unloved</h2>
                  <p class="body_text"> 
                     This album brings the femme fatale vibes with a shroud of mystery. The sounds on this are 
                     psychedlic, grand, and so very effortlessly cool. It feels naughtily seductive at times, but also 
                     feels like floating in space all the way to the pearly gates above, only you find G*d is actually a lesbian and a serial 
                     killer. <br>
                     Not sold? Watch (or at least look up) Killing Eve. I discovered Unloved from the show and was utterly 
                     floored to know this album was released 2 years before the show aired. One of the best things about Killing Eve is impecabbly 
                     timed and composed music. Seriously, the music develops with the plot and frequently provides important allegories, it punctuates everything in the show and drives the drama. 
                     It's so amusing how perfectly it lines up. I don't think I've witnessed another 
                     instance of 2 entirely independant works of art in 2 entirely independant spheres mirror each other perfectly like this.<br>
                     This as an album that feels exhilerating to mindfully listen to. The way this album discusses love and life feels dangerous in 
                     a way that's self-indulgently exciting. It feels like a thriller journey, but it is such a fun listen. I would give anything to hear this 
                     for the first time again - hands down one of my favorite listens of this year!<br>
                     My favorites on this are Xpectations, When a Woman Is Around, and Cry Baby Cry. </p>

                  <p class="body_text"> I stumbled upon this accidentally while searching for a song (can't remember which, Doja Cat maybe?) and instantly loved it.<br>
                     This album is tastefully cacophonous, which makes for some interesting, edgy sounds throughout. That, combined with the warm mumble of the lead, result in a listening experience that feels like
                     crashing your car and being carried through a blinding tunnel of light to the grand abyss. The psychedlic sounds are engrossing without being unnerving, an easy fate to befall most experimental-sound music.<br>
                     Despite the fact that the instrumentals and sounds are the star of this album, I found myself drawn to the few songs with prominent vocals on this album.
                     I really enjoyed Black Rice and Group Transport Hell

                  <p class="date_text">Oct, 2023</p>
                  <h2 class="title_text">The Land is Inhospitable and So Are We <br> Mitski</h2>
                  <p class="body_text"> This is one of the best albums of 2023 for me. My love and appreciation for Mitski only compounded tenfolds after listening to this a couple times. I think 
                     Mitski really outdid herself on this album.<br>
                     In true Mitski fashion, this album is not devoid of those heavy, existential themes of self-exploration, love and vulnerability, and the overall human condition. 
                     I was (pleasantly) surprised to see another album, after Laurel Hell addressed ideas of coming to term with reitrement and not making art anymore. I think you can see that in the production on this: it feels fiercely vulnerable and more intimate compared to the ironically commercial pop-y sounds on Laurel Hell.<br>
                     The tone is almost the same on all the tracks, which gives this album a nice cohesiveness. It has a very country-swing sound to it and a unique orchestral support that is pretty much constant on all the tracks. 
                     The imagery drawn from the nature theme that reoccurs in some of the songs helps paint that dreamy, gentle countryside setting. <br>
                     To me, this album is best enjoyed outdoors, at night. Preferably where you can stargaze/watch the moon.<br>
                     Some of my favorites inclue: Heaven, Buffalo Replaced, I'm Your Man, and My Love, Mine All Mine.

                  <p class="date_text">Sept, 2023</p>
                  <h2 class="title_text">Guts <br> Olivia Rodrigo</h2>
                  <p class="body_text"> Relative to Sour (her debut album), 
                     this album is a huge improvement in so many avenues.<br.>
                     Guts shows us the era of Olivia Rodrigo finding her voice, both literally and metaophorically. Her vocals are much improved and controlled on the songs here,
                     and you notice this especially in the live performances. Metaphorically though, I think Olivia Rodrigo is crafting a name for herself as the new emo pop-punk girlie 
                     on the block (Avril Lavigne and Hayley Williams....take a walk, your time is up). It's hard to break from the shackles of being dubbed a Disney-type singer 
                     your whole career, so I love seeing her cement her place in the industry as an independant and 
                     powerful artist.<br>
                     As a young artist with a brand of playful teen angst, this album tells a story of young love and grappling with feelings of 
                     insecurity and embarrassment as a young adult. 
                     I was disappointed (but not surprised) to see this album received a lot of backlash and even 
                     unwarranted misogynistic hate for being unapologetically an album about the struggles and rage of being a young woman in the world and 
                     public eye. I've heard reviews call this album childish, immature, misandrist, blah blah...... but please, check your misogny at the door before this one: 
                     the songs on this album are universal to anyone with a timeless pop-punk energy that is so invigorating and fun.<br> 
                     Some (few) songs on this are a skip for me, though I understand the decision to include a wider variety of sounds and production so not to limit herself within the confines of a specific 
                     genre.
                     Objectively speaking, this is overall a very solid album; I see this as a top contender for best album of the year! <br>
                     Some of my favorites are Ballad of a Homeschooled Girl, Vampire, and Love is Embarrassing.

                  <h2 class="title_text">Humbug <br> Arctic Monkeys</h2>
                  <p class="body_text"> This is one of my favorite rock albums of all time by one of my favorite bands.
                     I can't remember when I discovered this first, but I heard it completely fromt start to finish for the first time this September. <br> 
                     Alex Turner is a very talented writer and storyteller. He brings that devilish charm in all his verses and 
                     relies heavily on well constructed metaphors to take us on a journey of dangerous, bizzare and passionate love. 
                     He pines for romance (or at least, relations) in almost all the tracks on this, but manages to compose 10 songs
                     with an exclusively special sound and energy each. <br>
                     This album combines sweaty, grunge garage-punk sounds with clever lyrics and addicting music. Alex Turner's voice is brash and lovelorn in the same breath all throughout and it is sometimes gutwrenching but always dreamy. 
                     The drums on this album are f*cking electrifying, it's maddening to think how good it sounds. Surprise changes of key and tempo throughout keep every song on this fresh. 
                     No matter how many times I listen to this, I enjoy it like it's my first time.<br>
                     My favorites are Cornerstone (no one makes a red flag this glaring seem so romantic like Alex Turner,
                     the man knows how to yearn), Crying Lightning, and My Propeller.
                  </p>

                  <div class="about_img" style="max-width: 50%; height: auto;"><img src="images/unrealUnearth.jpg"></div>

                  <h2 class="title_text">Unreal Unearth <br> Hozier</h2>
                  <p class="body_text"> What to say about Hozier that hasn't already been said?<br>
                     I enjoyed this for the same reason most people enjoy Hozier: his lyrics are poetry, and he has one of the best voices in this generation's musical sphere. Hozier's voice is simultaneously angelic and fierce, and this album 
                     showcases his range across a wide spectrum.<br>
                     There is a lot of musical diversity on this album. I feel like I know the songs individually decently well enough to comment, but not the actual album - not from a lack of listens, rather the fact that some songs
                     sound very different, you'd think they were from completely different albums. The single Eat Your Young - with groovy funk-pop sounds and a catchy chorus- was what I think to be a misleading single
                     to promote the album. 
                     Thematically though,I enjoyed the Greek Mythology/Dante's Inferno crossover metaphor that is consistent throughout (is it really Hozier without religous and literary themes?). I think it amplifies the pure passion that mkes listening to Hozier such the spiritual experience it can be.
                     <br>
                     I think all the songs are interesting as a stand-alone for the most part, and I actually love a lot of them. I'm mostly just confused honestly (Damage Gets Done??? I understand how it's relevant to the ongoing theme of humanity and love/loss, but it feels like mainstream pop, reminds me of a Disney movie almost).
                     My favorites from this are Icarian, Who we Are, and De Selby (pt. 2).

                  <h2 class="title_text">Fevers and Mirrors <br>Bright Eyes</h2>
                  <p class="body_text">Most people only know that one Bright Eyes song (First Day of My Life), which is why I love showing people this album. everyone forgets Bright Eyes are 
                     primarily a rock band. This album is full of fiery white boy angst and a signature Bright Eyes quavering voice that is almost annoying at times, but it packs a punch nonetheless with 
                     some pretty good rock ballads.<br>
                     Regardless of the genre, Connor Oberst continues to deliver as the OG sad boy&trade; of the 21st centery. 
                     On this album, he sings with the desperation of someone who's succumbed to their misery and paranoia. His delivery on this album sounds so personal and urgent it feels like a cry for help.
                     This album has a very "tortured artist" air to it, as evident in both the lyrics and the way they're delivered. For the most part, there is a sincerity 
                     to the songs on this album - it's hard not to be sincere when you're singing with such emotion.<br>
                     My only grievances are with the 6 minute scripted mock interview at the end of An Attempt to Tip the Scales, where an actor (Todd Fink) plays the voice of Connor.
                     The song itself is no more than 2 minutes long, with the interview at the end calling the album brilliant (yes, this is on the original record). 
                     The premise of it feels somewhat egomaniacal and tasteless, consequently rendering the entire album a little too try-hard. It feels like Connor Oberst wants the world 
                     to see how different his pain is, and consequently how unique his work is - which to be fair, it's pretty special. While I don't necessarily think it added 
                     anything of value to the album like he'd hoped, I like this album too much to let it ruin it for me. Connor Oberst.....take a breath babe.....<br>
                     
                     I really enjoyed The Calendar Hung Itself, Sunrise, Sunset, and Haligh, Haligh, A Lie, Haligh.

                  <h2 class="title_text">Did you know that there's a tunnel under Ocean Blvd <br>Lana Del Rey</h2>
                  <p class="body_text">This is one of my favorite 2023 albums and one of overall Lana (and Jack Antonoff) favorites!<br>
                     Lana makes use of those signature, hymn-like vocals to transport the listener on this journey of sublime love, lust, and the performance of being a woman under patriarchal gender roles.
                     Like a lot of her music, many of the songs on this album sound soft and ethereal, with a lot of songs having a spoken word/slam poetry feel, which feels different from 
                     the usual hip-hop rock vibes. I think this is a rare instance of a Jack Antonoff production sounding entirely unique, even refreshing and creatively challenging.<br>
                     The ability to create such an expansive, sombre album with deep, dark instrumentals like this one cements Lana as a creative entity of her own weight-class. This album feels more carefree than her previous, giving us unique insights into Lana's 
                     perception of self and relationships (especially from the perspective of the other woman, which Lana sings about...a lot, but never from the first person like in A&W) <br>
                     I think this album has some of the best written songs of her career. It's also impressive how many collaborations are on this album, and how despite having such different musical backgrounds, they each come together to effortlessly support 
                     the angelic lead vocals, often leading to exciting harmonies like in Let the Light In and Maragret.<br>
                     The only grievance I have with this album is how long it is. Clocking at a whopping 1hr and almost 20mins spanning 16 songs, the latter half of the album winds down to soft acoustic instrumentals and quiet 
                     backing harmonies, losing that momentum the first half was building up. That is not to say the second half is not well written or beautifully delivered, but the story feels almost drawn out at times. <br>
                     Some of my favorites, and objectively, some of the best in her career, are The Grants, A&W, Let the Light In, and Paris,Texas.

                  <p class="date_text">April, 2023</p>
                  <h2 class="title_text">The Record <br>Boygenius</h2>
                  <p class="body_text">This album is about being in love - not in the traditional, romantic sense, but in a (heavily implied) platonic sense. This album draws from 
                     the band's personal and intimate non-romantic relationships with each other. Boygenius model their values of challenging heteropatriarchal restraints both in their personal lives,
                     and in their art/on-stage presence: a quality unique to their brand.<br>
                     The range on this album is impressive, esepcially because as a unit, it tells a very clear story about love, however you interpet that. 
                     To me, this album proves that Boygenius transcend the reductionist trope of "sad-girl" music, and challenge both societal standards for an all-female indie band, as well as 
                     societal standards and expectations for what love - more importantly, being in love - is and what it's supposed to look like. <br>
                     This album feels so personal and intimate, that it provides a parasocial sense of camraderie in the comfort of being understood by a band of people 
                     whose identity aligns with yours.<br>
                     Despite the personal aspect of the voices behind the art, this is objectively a strong contender for my favorite album of 2023. The album does a good job showcasing the trio's musical talent
                     in many angles, giving multiple opportunities for lead songs, as well as piercing supporting harmonies that are part of Boygenius's X-Factor. The 3 of them complement each other so strongly and effortlessly, 
                     it amplifies everyone's best qualities and the overall sincerity in their songs.<br>
                     Lucy Dacus shines on multiple acapella tracks, bringing her classic style of strong imagery and vivid storytelling to life with gentle acoustic strums (it's no coincidence they're arguably the saddest on the album). Julien Baker provides a much needed change of pace with some existential swing-rock
                     and some insane music. The frenzied drums on $20 dollars are so 90s rock nostalgia, and make for a very interesting listen. Pheobe Bridgers shines as the ambassador to all pensive indie-music, 
                     with earnest and desperate vocals on songs like Emily I'm Sorry that delves into themes of failure within relationships and inadequacy. <br>
                     The harmonies on this album are nothing short of pure magic, and the way their individual styles shine through without eclipsing one another is a delight. I love a lot of the songs on here, but some of my favorites include Emily I'm Sorry, 
                     We're In Love, $20 and True Blue.

                  <p class="date_text">Oct, 2022</p>
                  <h2 class="title_text">Midnights (3AM version) <br>Taylor Swift</h2>
                  <p class="body_text">I'm not even going to talk about the non 3 AM version, because I think that was a mistake. Midnights would be a weak and rather boring 
                     album without some of the songs starting from track 13 onwards.<br>
                     I felt like Midnights did a good job incorporating that mature penmanship style we saw in Folklore and Evermore with the 
                     classic pop production the duo of Taylor Swift and Jack Antonoff are known for putting out with her previous sounds.
                     Midnights made use of some well-placed synths and autotune which separated this album from any bodies of work Taylor Swift's come up with before.
                     I think there were some interesting and even experimental sounds on this album, which are not really words you associate with Taylor Swift - 
                     a pop mongol of the 21st century, in no small part to the fact that her music is often thematically flat and sonically repetitive. That is not to say that 
                     her music is not interesting, I just think it's a tradeoff between pushing the creative latitude as an artist and appealing to a mass audience of consumers, 
                     and it's rather obvious to anyone which of the two classifications she falls under. <br>
                     To me, this album talks about Taylor Swift's experiences with relationships, love, and struggles with self-image. While this is not an unusual direction 
                     to take for her, it feels as though the perspective has shifted on Midnights. Midnights provides a unique insights on Taylor's struggles with her self-identity, and her 
                     struggles navigating the binary of gender roles, 2 perspectives we've never seen. The album opens up with Lavendar Haze, talking about how she rejects the specualtions and expectations the 
                     world has placed on her to be "someone's wife" rather than arguably the most successful pop-star in the current world. We get authentic and sincere glimpses into Taylor's psyche with songs like 
                     Anti-Hero and Labyrinth.<br>
                     Overall, I really enjoyed this album; it's undeniable that Taylor Swift knows what the recipe to a successful album is, but it's nice to see her take more liberties with her art given that 
                     she has so much grace to do so. I particularly loved Glitch, The Great War, and Would've, Could've, Should've
