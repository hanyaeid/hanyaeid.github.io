                     Even though I only discovered this EP in the final days of this year, it's easily in my top 3. <br>
                     This EP is a very uplifting, casual listen. The instrumentals are a very funky 80's-future aesthetic that's so relaxing. The overall sound is very smooth and
                     dreamy, I thoroughly enjoyed every second of it.<br> 
                     The 3 tracks compete very strongly with each other for best, but I really like the instrumental breakdown at the end of My Jinji </p>

                  <p class="body_text">While this wasn't my first listen, it was my most recent and it reminded me of how much and why I love this album.<br>
                     Mitski's lyricism is unparalleled - for a debut album, the themes and the execution are minblowingly sophiscated. The sounds and emotions on this are uniquely harrowing; Mitski tackles issues of womanhood and societal expectations with simple yet emotive language . It's definitely not an everyday-casual 
                     listen, but it's a masochistic delight.<br>
                  It's hard to pick favorites, but Brand New City, Liquid Smooth and Bag of Bones are top 3 for sure. </p>

                  <p class="date_text">Dec, 2023</p>
                  <h2 class="title_text">Historian <br>Lucy Dacus</h2>
                  <p class="body_text"> My first, uninterrupted listen for this album was very recent, and I was not disappointed. <br>
                     Lucy Dacus has a signature warm, lullaby-esque voice that rings out in your mind. It is gentle and crisp and powerful all at the same time.<br>
                     As an artist, her style places heavy emphasis in the story she's singing, and in this album, it's a story of grief and self-discovery, mostly in the way we relate to and live through people. 
                     Historian showcases Dacus's ability to make music that is relatable in more than one sense; while Lucy sings about such familiar and 
                     quintiessential parts of the experience of love and loss, she does it in a way that centers and immerses the listener in a story told so vividly, it's 
                     almost impossible not to self-project onto the songs here.<br>
                     Night Shift is one of Dacus's best songs of all time - the instrumental build up overlayed with the strained scream-vocals and grungy guitar make it objectively one of the 
                     best songs ever. I also really like Addictions, Yours & Mine, and The Shell</p>

                  <p class="body_text"> I stumbled upon this accidentally while searching for a song (can't remember which, Doja Cat maybe?) and instantly loved it.<br>
                     This album is tastefully cacophonous, which makes for some interesting, edgy sounds throughout. That, combined with the warmth mumble of the lead, result in a listening experience that feels like
                     crashing your car and being carried through a blinding tunnel of light to the grand abyss. The psychedlic sounds are engrossing without being unnerving, an easy fate to befall most experimental-sound music.<br>
                     Despite the fact that the instrumentals and sounds are the star of this album, I found myself drawn to the few songs with prominent vocals on this album.
                     I really enjoyed Black Rice, Group Transport Hell

                  <h2 class="title_text">The Land is Inhospitable and So Are We <br> Mitski</h2>
                  <p class="body_text"> This is one of the best albums of 2023 for me. My love and appreciation for Mitski only compounded tenfolds after listening to this a couple times. I think 
                     Mitski really outdid herself on this album.<br>
                     In true Mitski fashion, this album is not devoid of those heavy, existential themes of self-exploration, love and vulnerability, and the overall human condition. 
                     I was (pleasantly) surprised to see another album, after Laurel Hell addressed ideas of coming to term with reitrement and not making art anymore. I think you can see that in the production on this: it feels fiercely vulnerable and more intimate compared to the ironically commercial pop-y sounds on Laurel Hell.<br>
                     The tone is almost the same on all the tracks, which gives this album a nice cohesiveness. It has a very country-swing sound to it and a unique orchestral support that is pretty much constant on all the tracks. 
                     The imagery drawn from the nature theme that recurs in some of the songs helps reinforce that gentle acoustic country tune you feel. <br>
                     To me, this album is best enjoyed outdoors, at night. Preferably where you can stargaze/watch the moon.<br>
                     Some of my favorites inclue: Heaven, Buffalo Replaced, I'm Your Man, and My Love, Mine All Mine.

                  <h2 class="title_text">Humbug <br> Arctic Monkeys</h2>
                  <p class="body_text"> This is one of my favorite rock albums of all time by one of my favorite bands. Goes without saying, I enjoy this album regularly.
                     This is an album I knew like the back of my hand already, but had heard completely fromt start to finish for the first time this September. <br> 
                     This album combines sweaty, grunge garage-punk sounds with earnest lyrics and tone. Alex Turner's voice is brash and lovelorn in the same breath all throughout and it is sometimes gutwrenching but always dreamy. 
                     The drums on this album are f*cking electrifying, it's maddening to think how good it sounds. Coupled with iconic guitar riffs and electric tones , it's a must listen for anyone.<br>
                     My favorites are Cornerstone (no one does romantic yearning like Alex Turner, the witty lyrics on this are also so satisfying ), Crying Lightning, and My Propeller.

                  <div class="about_img" style="max-width: 50%; height: auto;"><img src="images/unrealUnearth.jpg"></div>
                  <p class="date_text">Aug, 2023</p>
                  <h2 class="title_text">Unreal Unearth <br> Hozier</h2>
                  <p class="body_text"> What to say about Hozier that hasn't already been said?<br>
                     I enjoyed this for the same reason most people enjoy Hozier: his lyrics are poetry, and he has one of the best voices in this generation's musical sphere. Hozier's voice is simultaneously angelic and fierce, and this album 
                     showcases his range across a wide spectrum.<br>
                     There is a lot of musical diversity on this album. I feel like I know the songs individually decently well enough to comment, but not the actual album - not from a lack of listens, rather the fact that some songs
                     sound very different, you'd think they were from completely different albums. The single Eat Your Young - with groovy funk-pop sounds and a catchy chorus- was what I think to be a misleading single
                     to promote the album. 
                     Thematically though,I enjoyed the Greek Mythology/Dante's Inferno crossover metaphor that is consistent throughout (is it really Hozier without religous and literary themes?). I think it amplifies the piercing passion 
                     Hozier sings with.<br>
                     I think all the songs are interesting as a stand-alone for the most part, and I actually love a lot of them. I'm mostly just confused honestly (Damage Gets Done??? I understand how it's relevant to the ongoing theme of humanity and love/loss, but it feels like mainstream pop, reminds me of a Disney movie almost).
                     My favorites from this are Icarian, Who we Are, and De Selby (pt. 2).

                  <p class="body_text">While I wouldn't consider this a summer album, it's forever a summer melancholy album for me. Connor Oberst continues to deliver as the OG sad boy&trade; of the 21st centery. <br>
                     This album is full of fiery white boy angst and a signature Bright Eyes quavering voice that is almost annoying at times, but it packs a punch nonetheless with 
                     some pretty good rock ballads. There's a wide range of production on this album, from acoustic piano to slide guitars and heavy rock themes, but it never disappoints to me.<br>
                     The Calendar Hung Itself is a very exciting, intense and addicting song. I also really enjoyed the rawness in Haligh, Haligh, a Lie, Haligh.
                     Overall, a success from this nepo baby! (Although the interview in the end of An Attempt to Tip the Scales felt pretentious, especially after finding out it was scripted)

                  <p class="date_text">April, 2023</p>
                  <h2 class="title_text">The Record <br>Boygenius</h2>
                  <p class="body_text">This album is about being in love - not in the traditional, romantic sense, but in a (heavily implied) platonic sense. This album draws from 
                     the band's personal and intimate non-romantic relationships with each other. Boygenius model their values of challenging heteropatriarchal restraints both in their personal lives,
                     and in their art/on-stage presence: a quality unique to their brand.<br>
                     The range on this album is impressive, esepcially because as a unit, it tells a very clear story about love, however you interpet that. 
                     To me, this album proves that Boygenius transcend the reductionist trope of "sad-girl" music, and challenge both societal standards for an all-female indie band, as well as 
                     societal standards and expectations for what love - more importantly, being in love - is and what it's supposed to look like. <br>
                     This album feels so personal and intimate, that it provides a parasocial sense of camraderie in the comfort of being understood by a band of people 
                     whose identity aligns with yours.<br>
                     Despite the personal aspect of the voices behind the art, this is objectively a strong contender for my favorite album of 2023. The album does a good job showcasing the trio's musical talent
                     in many angles, giving multiple opportunities for lead songs, as well as piercing supporting harmonies that are part of Boygenius's X-Factor. The 3 of them complement each other so strongly and effortlessly, 
                     it amplifies everyone's best qualities and the overall sincerity in their songs.<br>
                     Lucy Dacus shines on multiple acapella tracks, bringing her classic style of strong imagery and vivid storytelling to life with gentle acoustic strums (it's no coincidence they're arguably the saddest on the album). Julien Baker provides a much needed change of pace with some existential swing-rock
                     and some insane music. The frenzied drums on $20 dollars are so 90s rock nostalgia, and make for a very interesting listen. Pheobe Bridgers shines as the ambassador to all pensive indie-music, 
                     with earnest and desperate vocals on songs like Emily I'm Sorry that delves into themes of failure within relationships and inadequacy. <br>
                     The harmonies on this album are nothing short of pure magic, and the way their individual styles shine through without eclipsing one another is a delight. I love a lot of the songs on here, but some of my favorites include Emily I'm Sorry, 
                     We're In Love, $20 and True Blue.
